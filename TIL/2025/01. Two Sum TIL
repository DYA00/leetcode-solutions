(Description of the Problem)
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

--- Solution ---
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int first = 0;
        int second = 0;
        boolean found = false;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length & !found; i++) {
            for (int j = i+1; j < nums.length & !found; j++) {
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] == target) {
                    first = i;
                    second = j;
                    found = true;
                }
            }
        }

        int[] answer = {first, second};
        return answer;
    }
}

--- Approach ---
# Key Concepts
Using nested loop to find the right one indices in the int array.
Because it was given only one exact set of two numbers is existed, I used boolean found value, to quit the loop immediately when I found the answer.

# Improvement
The time complexity of this code is O(n^2) due to nested loop.
For code efficiency, I found the Hash map concept to make it faster.
