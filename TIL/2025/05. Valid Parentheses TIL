(Description)
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

--- Solution ---
class Solution {
    public boolean isValid(String s) {
        Map<Character, Character> matching = new HashMap<>();
        matching.put (')', '(');
        matching.put ('}', '{');
        matching.put (']', '[');

        Stack<Character> stack= new Stack<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char bracket = s.charAt(i);

            if (matching.containsValue(bracket)) {
                stack.push(bracket);
            }
            else if (matching.containsKey(bracket)) {
                if (stack.isEmpty()) return false;
                
                char preBracket = stack.pop();
                if (preBracket != matching.get(bracket)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }

        }

        return stack.isEmpty();
    }
}

# Key Concepts
How to use the stack is the main point in this problem.
The most important thing in this algorithmn is wheather is the brackest are correctly matching.
Therefore, followed the simple three rules, it was just okay, to check relation with previous brackest when it was closing one.

# What I learned
I reminded how the stack and HashMap functions.
And, I think this code could improve its efficiency with another loop.
