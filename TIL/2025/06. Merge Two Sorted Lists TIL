(Description)
You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists into one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

        ListNode mergedList = dummy;
        
        while (list1 != null && list2 != null) {
            if (list1.val <= list2.val) {
                mergedList.next = list1;
                list1 = list1.next;
            }
            else {
                mergedList.next = list2;
                list2 = list2.next;
            }
            mergedList = mergedList.next;
        }

        if (list1 == null) {
            while (list2 != null) {
                mergedList.next = list2;
                list2 = list2.next;
                mergedList = mergedList.next;
            }
        }
        else if (list2 == null) {
            while (list1 != null) {
                mergedList.next = list1;
                list1 = list1.next;
                mergedList = mergedList.next;
            }
        }

        return dummy.next;
    }
}

#Key Concepts
How to return the merged list was a problem in here, and Using the dummy node could easily solve it.
And, I kept comparing between two lists until one is gonna be null.
Then, if the while loop is done due to one became the null, another while loop would work fpr the last merging process, filling the merged list throuout the unnulled list.
