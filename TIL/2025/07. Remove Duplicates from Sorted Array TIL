(Description)
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.

Consider the number of unique elements in nums to be k​​​​​​​​​​​​​​. After removing duplicates, return the number of unique elements k.

The first k elements of nums should contain the unique numbers in sorted order. The remaining elements beyond index k - 1 can be ignored.

Custom Judge:

The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length

int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}
If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.

--- Solution ---
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int current = nums[0];
        int prev;
        int k = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            prev = current;
            current = nums[i];
            if (current > prev) {
                nums[k] = current;
                k ++;
            }
        }

        return k;
    }
}

--- Approach ---
# Key Point
Because it evalute until the index k, which is the unique number of the sorted array,
the main point of this solution is making the sorted array perfect until the index k.
Therefore, I didn't need another loop to make the sorted array rearrange or decrease its length.
I just put the unique numbers into the k position one by one.
