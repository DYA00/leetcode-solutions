(Description)
Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.

Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
Return k.

--- Custom Judge:
The judge will test your solution with the following code:

int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
int val = ...; // Value to remove
int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length.
                            // It is sorted with no values equaling val.

int k = removeElement(nums, val); // Calls your implementation

assert k == expectedNums.length;
sort(nums, 0, k); // Sort the first k elements of nums
for (int i = 0; i < actualLength; i++) {
    assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
}

--- Solution ---
class Solution {
    public int removeElement(int[] nums, int val) {
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i ++) {
            if (nums[i] != val) {
                nums[count] = nums[i];
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}

--- Approach ---
The main points of this problem is tracking the number that is not equal with val in the nums, and rearranging the integer array.
But the description said, it doesn't matter the after the index of tracking number in the rearranged array.

Therefore, in my algorithmn, I looped the array from first to last, and adding one if it it doesn't match with the val.
And then, put the int of the orginial nums, to the arranged one at the counted position.
