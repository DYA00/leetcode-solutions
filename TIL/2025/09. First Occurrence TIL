(Description)
Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

--- Soltuion ---
class Solution {
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
        if (haystack.length() < needle.length()) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        for(int i = 0; i <= haystack.length() - needle.length(); i++) {
            if (haystack.substring(i, i + needle.length()).equals(needle)) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }
}

--- Approach ---
Loop the String haystack from first to the index that has the possibility to hold needle.
At each looped time, figured out the substring of haystack into the same length with needle,
and if it is same, returned the current position, which is int i.
