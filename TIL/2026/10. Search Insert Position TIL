(Description)
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

--- Solution ---
class Solution {
    public int searchInsert(int[] nums, int target) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] >= target) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        return nums.length;
    }
}

--- Approach ---
Because it was given sorted integers array, it was easy to find the solution with one loop.
From first to the last, compare the each index's int, and the target,
and if the index's number is equal or bigger than the target,
I returned the index, i at this case.

And, then when the loop was done, if any number was returned,
that means that the number should be the after the last index,
therefore I let it return its length, if nothing was returned after the loop.
