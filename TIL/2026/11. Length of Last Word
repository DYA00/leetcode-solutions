(Description)
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

--- Solution ---
class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLastWord(String s) {
        int blank = 0;
        String lastWord = "";

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.substring(i, i + 1).equals(" ")) {
                blank = i + 1;
            }
            else {
                lastWord = s.substring(blank, i + 1);
            }
        }

        return lastWord.length();
    }
}

--- Approach ---
Loop from first to the last, and keep tracking the blanks,
if it find the blanks, it reset the starting index of the last word,
then when it reaches to the last, it will return the length of the stored word's length.

# Improvement Point
If the loop started from backward, algorithm will be more efficient.
