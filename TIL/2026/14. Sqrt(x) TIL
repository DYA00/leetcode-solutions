(Description)
Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.
You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

--- Solution ---
class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        int num = 1;

        while (x / num > num) {
            num ++;
        }

        if (x / num == num) {
            return num;
        }
        else {
            return num - 1;
        }
    }
}

--- Approach ---
Using loop, I find the point when x divided by num is over num that is the most close one to its square.
Due to it doesn't require to return its round number, 
from the found point, using if statement, I return the num or num - 1.

# Improvement
Using the loop to increment one by one was not efficient way to find the answer.
Maybe, arraying of int would be save the efficiency more.
