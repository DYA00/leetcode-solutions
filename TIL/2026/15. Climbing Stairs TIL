(Description)
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

--- Solution ---
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n <= 2) {
            return n;
        }

        int prev2 = 1;
        int prev1 = 2;

        for(int i = 3; i <= n; i ++) {
            int current = prev1 + prev2;

            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = current;
        }

        return prev1;
    }
}

--- Approach ---
It is asking the combination of steps with 1 and 2.
Typically there are two general cases in there,
1. one is n-2, which is left two steps until n (prev2)
2. The other one is n-1, which is left one step until n (prev1)

(Key Point)
In the n-1 case, the only way to approach n is one, taking 1 step.
While, in the n-2 case, there are two ways to approach n; taking two 1 steps, or one 2 step.

However, due to it is not number of steps, but combination of steps,
even if it take one more one step, the combination was not changed.

That means next n's combination is prev1 + prev2,
so that I loop from 3 to the n, to reach out n, keeping addition prev1, and prev2 under the logic.
