(Description)
Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

--- Solution ---
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) {
            return null;
        }

        ListNode current = head;

        while (current.next != null) {
            if (current.val == current.next.val) {
                current.next = current.next.next;
            }
            else {
                current = current.next;
            }
        }

        return head;
    }
}

--- Approach ---
Basic problem, regarding of the basic understanding in the concept of the Linked List.

(Key Point)
Using while loop it cover from head to the last node.
In the loop, throughout if statement compare current and next val,
1. If two values were same, change the next node to the next of next one
2. Else, just change the current node to the next node.
