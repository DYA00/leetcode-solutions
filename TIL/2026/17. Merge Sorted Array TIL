(Description)
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. 
To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

--- Solution ---
class Solution {
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        int[] origin = nums1.clone();
        int count1 = 0;
        int count2 = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < m + n; i ++) {
            if (count1 == m) {
                nums1[i] = nums2[count2 ++];
            }
            else if (count2 == n) {
                nums1[i] = origin[count1 ++];
            }
            else {
                if (origin[count1] <= nums2[count2]) {
                    nums1[i] = origin[count1 ++];
                }
                else {
                    nums1[i] = nums2[count2 ++];
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

--- Approach ---
What I learned in this problem was that int array share its memory when it was declared with (=).
I could make a copy of the nums1 int array using (nums1.clone()).

I keep track the counts of two int arrays seperately, and manage the numbers under one for loop.
In there, with three different if cases, the values of two int arrays were compared and added to nums1 array from first to the last.
