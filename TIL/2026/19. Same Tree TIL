(Description)
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

--- Solution ---
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean isSameTree(TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if (p == null && q == null) {
            return true;
        }

        if (p == null || q == null || p.val != q.val) {
            return false;
        }
        return isSameTree(p.left, q.left) && isSameTree(p.right, q.right);
    }
}

--- Approach ---
Recursion is the key point of this algorithmn
From top to the bootom of the tree, it check only false case if the values are unequal or one is null but the other one is not.
And then, if there is no any false case in the recursion, at the most bottom, which two values are all null, it finally return true.
