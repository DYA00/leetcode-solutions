(Description)
Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

--- Solution ---
class Solution {
    public boolean isSymmetric(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return true;
        }

        return isMirror(root.left, root.right);
    }

    private boolean isMirror(TreeNode leftNode, TreeNode rightNode) {
        if (leftNode == null && rightNode == null) {
            return true;
        }

        if (leftNode == null || rightNode == null || leftNode.val != rightNode.val) {
            return false;
        }

        return isMirror(leftNode.left, rightNode.right) && isMirror(leftNode.right, rightNode.left);
    }
}

--- Approach ---
The key concept was recusrion in this node tree problem.
The base cases were same with the last problem of Same tree.

1. if both side node was all null, it return true.
2. if only one side node is null, or both side node have different value, it return false.
3. Then, it call recursion until to one of the base cases, but the return should be called symmetric(it was the key point in this problem),
  like leftNode's left, and rightNode's right, that is comparing each sides' edges.
  or leftNode's right, and rightNode's left, those are inner things of each sides.
