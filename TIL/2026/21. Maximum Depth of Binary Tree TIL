(Description)
Given the root of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

--- Solution ---
class Solution {
    public int maxDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }   

        int leftDepth = maxDepth(root.left);
        int rightDepth = maxDepth(root.right);

        return 1 + Math.max(leftDepth, rightDepth);
    }
}

--- Approach ---
Recursive was the key concept of this problem.
The base case of the recursive is when the root node is null, then return 0.
Other cases, it calculate the left and right side depth,
becuase it return 1 + the calculated value, that means every time of calculating the value, it add 1.

Then, when it hit the base case, it return 0, added every added 1, which is the maximum depth of the given binary tree.
