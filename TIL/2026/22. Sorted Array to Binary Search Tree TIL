(Description)
Given an integer array nums where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.

--- Solution ---
class Solution {
    public TreeNode sortedArrayToBST(int[] nums) {
        if(nums == null) {
            return null;
        }

        return build(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
    }

    private TreeNode build(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        if (start > end) {
            return null;
        }

        int mid = (start + end) / 2;
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);

        root.left = build(nums, start, mid - 1);
        root.right = build(nums, mid + 1, end);

        return root;
    }
}

--- Approach ---
1. At first, if the given array, nums was null, it returns null.
2. Using recursion, it build the TreeNode, one by one.
3. In the recursion, it ask start and end value, they role like boundary dividing left side and right side to fill the Binary Tree.
4. If start value was bigger than the end one, it stop the recursion (Base case).
5. Other cases, it calculate the int mid, using given two numbers of start and end.
6. Then, generate another new TreeNode, with the value from the nums at the mid position.
