(Description)
Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

--- Solution ---
class Solution {
    public boolean isBalanced(TreeNode root) {
        return height(root) != -1;
    }

    private int height(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;

        int leftSide = height(root.left);
        if (leftSide == -1) return -1;
        
        int rightSide = height(root.right);
        if (rightSide == -1) return -1;

        if (Math.abs(leftSide - rightSide) > 1) return -1;

        return Math.max(leftSide,rightSide) + 1;
    }
}

--- Approach ---
1. Base Case: if the current node is null, stop the recursion.
2. Left-Side & Right-Side: if the leftSide and rightSide were -1, meaning there are not height balanced, the recursion return -1.
3. Height Balanced: in each node, if the height difference is more than 1, it return -1, or the Binary Tree's height.
