(Description)
Given a binary tree, find its minimum depth.
The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.
Note: A leaf is a node with no children.

--- Solution ---
class Solution {
    public int minDepth(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null)
            return 0;
        
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null)
            return 1;

        if (root.left == null) 
            return 1 + minDepth(root.right);
        if (root.right == null)
            return 1 + minDepth(root.left);

        return 1 + Math.min(minDepth(root.left), minDepth(root.right));
    }
}

--- Approach ---
There were two base cases,
1. If current root is null, return 0.
2. When next left and right nodes are null together, return 1.

Then, there were three cases in recursion step.
1. If only left node is null, return recursion for the right node.
2. But, in null of right node, return recursion with left node.
3. Without any null in the next nodes, it returns the min value between recursion for left and right nodes.
