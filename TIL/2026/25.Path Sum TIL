(Description)
Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

--- Solution ---
class Solution {
    public boolean hasPathSum(TreeNode root, int targetSum) {
        if (root == null) 
            return false;
        
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) 
            return root.val == targetSum;

        int remainedSum = targetSum - root.val;

        return hasPathSum(root.left, remainedSum) || hasPathSum(root.right, remainedSum);
    }
}

--- Approach ---
Basically, this recursion subtract targetSum by root.val in each step.
So that, it compares the last leaf's value and subtracted number.

1. At first if the root is null, there is no any number to subtract, so that it returns false.
2. When it reached to the leaf: both of left and right nodes is null, return true if the root.val is same with subtracted targetSum.

Before the leaf,
The recursion kept calculating the subtracted number, callled remainedSum.
Then, it called the recursion with left and right nodes throughout || operator.
