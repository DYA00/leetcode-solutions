(Description)
Given an integer numRows, return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.

--- Solution ---
class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> generate(int numRows) {
        List<List<Integer>> pascal = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numRows; i ++) {
            List<Integer> row = new ArrayList<>();

            for (int j = 0; j <= i; j ++) {
                if (j == 0 || j == i) {
                    row.add(1);
                }
                else {
                    List<Integer> prev = pascal.get(i - 1);
                    row.add(prev.get(j - 1) + prev.get(j));
                }
            }
            pascal.add(row);
        }
        return pascal;
    }
}

--- Approach ---
Key concpet was the nested loop.
In outer loop, it track the number of row, from 0 to until numRows - 1.
At this level, it made a new List for Inner Loop.

Then, in inner loop, it add the number into the list followed by the rule of Pascal's Triangle.
The common points were,
1. At first last position, it should hold 1. (So, when j == 0 or j == i, it added 1.)
2. Execpt the case of number 1, it always hold the value that was added at position j - 1 and j from the above row.

When, the inner loop was done, it was added to the list called pascal in the level of outer loop.
